			<p>Hello. My name is Daniel Winters.</p>
			<br>
			<br>
			<p>250 words isn't a whole lot when you think about it, so I started thinking of a way to get <a class="trigger" onclick='displaySecondary($(this).html())'>around</a> it. And a way to present my application as not just another 250 words.</p>
			<p class="secondary" id="around">And I came up with this. I used HTML / CSS, Javascript and jQuery, three coding languages that I have taught myself. To uncover the additional information, simply click the blue text. And to close the red text, click on it.</p>
			<br>
			<br>
			<p>From <a href="https://medium.com/maxistentialism-blog/star-trek-the-next-generation-in-40-hours-c4a6762cbd3" target="_blank">Medium's</a> ability to allow users to comment on individual paragraphs, <a href="http://www.tabletmag.com/jewish-news-and-politics/191806/the-illusionist-al-seckel" target="_blank">Tablet's</a> dynamic reading progress bar, and the BBC's own elegant <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/special/2014/newsspec_7617/index.html" target="_blank">scrolling articles</a>, digital news outlets are constantly <a class="trigger" onclick='displaySecondary($(this).html())'>changing</a>.</p>
			<p class="secondary" id="changing">And, in an annoying full disclosure, after the completion of this essay, I discovered that <a href="http://grantland.com/features/the-cult-jurassic-park/" target="_blank">Grantland</a> use an annotation system very similar to my own already.</p>
			<br>
			<br>
			<p>And whilst the news articles of the future won't include restrictive word counts, additional background details embedded in the article could become another weapon in the future for digital news outlet in the fight for continued <a class="trigger" onclick='displaySecondary($(this).html())'>engagement</a>.</p>
			<p class="secondary" id="engagement">This has also been a concept that video games have used for decades. It allows the most devoted players to delve into the extended lore, whilst letting the more linear players to simply bypass it all.</p>
			<br>
			<br>
			<p>I don’t believe that this additional information will ruin the succinct, pained nature of <a class="trigger" onclick='displaySecondary($(this).html())'>journalistic</a> writing, </p>
			<p class="secondary" id="journalistic">something that I have felt myself in my week at The Daily Telegraph, </p>
			<p>but will give the more inquisitive readers the longer answer they desire. All whilst keeping the traditional reading experience  <a class="trigger" onclick='displaySecondary($(this).html())'>intact</a>.</p>
			<p class="secondary" id="intact">And as I assume that these annotations will primarily be used in lengthy editorials, keeping the lazy-Saturday-morning-in-bed reading experience is critical.</p>
			<br>
			<br>
			<p>These thoughts are situated squarely between creativity and understanding your audience, the two aspects of writing that I find most interesting and <a class="trigger" onclick='displaySecondary($(this).html())'>wish</a> to work closely with.</p>
			<p class="secondary" id="wish">A wish that led me to enter the BJL Seat programme, and helped me place in the Top 20 of the BJL Brilliance awards for my submission</p>
			<br>
			<br>
			<p>And that's why I believe I am a good candidate for this role. Because not only am I a devoted to my writing craft, I’m also constantly thinking about, and creating, new ways for <a class="trigger" onclick='displaySecondary($(this).html())'>my</a></p>
			<p class="secondary" id="my">, and hopefully the BBC’s,</p>
			<p> writing to stay relevant in the digital future.</p>

			<h3>Hello. My name is Daniel Winters.</h3>
			<br>
			<p>250 words isn't a whole lot when you think about it, so I started thinking of a way to get <a class="trigger" onclick='displaySecondary($(this).html())'>around</a> it. And a way to present my application as not just another 250 words.</p>
			<p class="secondary" id="around">And I came up with this. I used HTML / CSS, Javascript and jQuery, three coding languages that I have taught myself. To uncover the additional information, simply click the blue text. And to close the red text, click on it.</p>
			<br>
			<br>
			<p>From <a href="https://medium.com/maxistentialism-blog/star-trek-the-next-generation-in-40-hours-c4a6762cbd3" target="_blank">Medium's</a> ability to allow users to comment on individual paragraphs, <a href="http://www.tabletmag.com/jewish-news-and-politics/191806/the-illusionist-al-seckel" target="_blank">Tablet's</a> dynamic reading progress bar, and the BBC's own elegant <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/special/2014/newsspec_7617/index.html" target="_blank">scrolling articles</a>, digital news outlets are constantly <a class="trigger" onclick='displaySecondary($(this).html())'>evolving</a>. It's imperative that our words not only speak well, but look the part too.</p>
			<p class="secondary" id="evolving">This concept of additonal information has also been used in video games have used for decades. It allows the most devoted players to delve into the extended lore, whilst letting the more linear players to simply bypass it all.</p>
			<br>
			<br>
			<p>And while the articles of the future won't include restrictive word counts or do away with the succint journalist house <a class="trigger" onclick='displaySecondary($(this).html())'>styles</a>, <p class="secondary" id="styles">something that I felt myself when I spent a week at the Daily Telegraph Culture Desk,</p> additional background details embedded in the article <a class="trigger" onclick='displaySecondary($(this).html())'>could</a> become another weapon in the continued fight for reader engagement.</p>
			<p class="secondary" id="could">And, in an annoying full disclosure, after the completion of this essay, I discovered that <a href="http://grantland.com/features/the-cult-jurassic-park/" target="_blank">Grantland</a> already use an annotation system very similar to my own already.</p>
			<br>
			<br>
			<p>These thoughts and advancements are situated squarely between creativity and understanding your audience. Two aspects of copywriting that I believe are my strongest and <a class="trigger" onclick='displaySecondary($(this).html())'>wish</a> to work with on a full-time basis.</p>
			<p class="secondary" id="wish">A wish that led me to make my own text adventure video games, and to take an interest in advertising copy as well. Most recently I entered the BJL Seat programme, and placed in the Top 20 of their Brilliance Awards.
			<br>
			<br>
			<p>And that's why I believe I am a good candidate for this role. Not only because I devoted to my writing craft, but also because I am constantly thinking about, and creating, new ways for <a class="trigger" onclick='displaySecondary($(this).html())'>my</a></p>
			<p class="secondary" id="my">, and hopefully the BBCâ€™s,</p>
			<p> writing to stay relevant in the digital future.</p>
